This is an example of a basic client server setup using 
netty and protobuf for the transport and serialization.

Your task is to get the code to build and run through
two terminals (a client and a server).

Technologies introduced:
1. Netty
2. Protobuf
3. JAXB


How to build: 
1. sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
2. ./build_pb.sh
3. ant

How to run:
1. server part:  ./startServer.sh
2. client part:   ./runPing.sh
